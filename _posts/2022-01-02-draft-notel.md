## FINANCIAL STATEMETNS
- income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement
- how a business is performing over a particular period
* * *
### INCOME STATEMENT: how much money a company brought in and how much of a profit (hopefully) it earned from that revenue.
- **Revenue**: how much money you earned including different sources of income. ex) Apple's income statement breaks its revenue into product sales and service revenue.

- Cost of Revenue (=Cost of Goods Sold): How much money it costs to make & distribute your product or service. it does not include operating expenses.

- **Gross Profit** (=Revenue - COGS): how **profitable** your product and servies are.

- Operating Expenses (overhead): All the other costs of running a business. ex) utilities, rent, support staff, R&D etc.

- **Operating Income/Loss** (=Gross Profit - Operating Expenses): shows how profitable & how efficient your business is overall.

- **Net income (=earnings=bottom line)**: From there, the company's cost of sales is subtracted to produce its gross income. Its operating costs (like research and development) are subtracted to calculate its operating income. Then income tax expenses are subtracted, and the result is the company's net income, also known as its "earnings." Net income is often expressed both as one large number and by share (the latter being earnings per share, or EPS).
  - Net income = Revenue - COGS - operating expenses - taxes

- Analysis
```
Gross profit margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales Revenue
```

### BALANCE SHEET: a company's financial condition at a given time
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- Analysis
```
Liquidity Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities (worse if lower)
```
* * *

### CASH FLOW STATEMENT: how much cash entered/left your business. show cash status!
- Cash from operating activity (buying or selling) (+/-)
- Account payable (+/-)
- Cash from Investing Activities(+/-)
- Cash from Financing Activities(+/-)
- Analysis
```
Cash Flow Coverage Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operations / Total Debt
```

- How does the business make its money?
- Have the business's revenue and earnings grown or shrunk?
- How much does the business own?
