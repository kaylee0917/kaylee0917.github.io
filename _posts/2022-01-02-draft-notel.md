#### FINANCIAL STATEMETNS
- income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement
- how a business is performing over a particular period

> INCOME STATEMENT: how much money a company brought in and how much of a profit (hopefully) it earned from that revenue.
>> The “top-line” number (=a company's net sales or revenue): In many cases a company's income statement will break down different sources of income. For example, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) income statement breaks its revenue into product sales and service revenue.

>> Net income (earnings): From there, the company's cost of sales is subtracted to produce its gross income. Its operating costs (like research and development) are subtracted to calculate its operating income. Then income tax expenses are subtracted, and the result is the company's net income, also known as its "earnings." Net income is often expressed both as one large number and by share (the latter being earnings per share, or EPS).

>> **revenues - costs (labor, products, etc) - tax - ETC = NET INCOME and EPS**

> BALANCE SHEET: a company's financial condition at a given time

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS**
- How does the business make its money?
- Have the business's revenue and earnings grown or shrunk?
- How much does the business own?
- How much does the business owe?
- Is there more money coming in or going out?
